### Set up a Companies House account

To be able to explore and perform tests with the Companies House API,
you need to register a [user account](/developer/signin) with Companies
House, and then generate an [API
key](/guides/apikeyAuthorisation) for use
in each API request.

### Explore the API

Each Companies House API reference page contains an embedded "explorer"
that allows the reader to try out the service *in-situ*, without having
to write any client code at all.
