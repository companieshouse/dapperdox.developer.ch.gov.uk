Companies House API
===================

Overview
--------

Companies House is an executive agency of the Department for Business
Innovation and Skills. Our main functions are to incorporate and
dissolve limited companies; examine and store company information
delivered under the Companies Act and related legislation; and make this
information available to the public.

Companies House digitally records almost all information it receives,
and makes this available to the public through its own website and
through the Companies House RESTful API. Being RESTful, each record of
information is assigned a globally unique URI, and the operations
available on each resource are directly mapped to HTTP verbs. Data can
therefore be easily consumed by issuing simple `GET` requests on the
required resource URI.

Beta release
------------

The Companies House API and Developer Hub are currently at a [beta
release](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle). We
are going through a process of user engagement to improve the API and
documentation.

We have a proposed approach to versioning the API and documentation that
is currently being [discussed in the Developer Hub
Forum](https://forum.aws.chdev.org/t/versioning-the-companies-house-api/248).
In the meantime existing resources will remain 'as is' and can be
considered as at 'version 0'.

Please refer to the [Developer Hub Forum](https://forum.aws.chdev.org/)
for ongoing feature and documentation discussions, and announcements on
upcoming feature releases.
